# Test-automation
Welcome to my project website built using Node.js and MongoDB as the robust backend to store people's data. This dynamic website allows users to perform CRUD operations seamlessly, enabling easy entry and deletion of data. My focus on test automation ensures a smooth user experience, as I use Eclipse IDE and Selenium to rigorously test various aspects of the website, such as data entry and deletion. Additionally,  automated tests include taking screenshots and generating comprehensive XML reports, providing valuable insights into test cases that passed or failed. This repository only contains the code for the test automation part.
